## Introduction to `racket/parser`
- **Query:** What is `(require racket/parser)`? What library is it?
- **Summary:** The initial inquiry was about understanding the specifics and functionalities of the `racket/parser` library.

## BNF-style Grammar for a Custom Language
- **Query:** Gimme a BNF-style grammar with specific rules and symbols.
- **Summary:** An overview of the desired grammar for a custom language in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) was presented.

## Translating the BNF Grammar to `brag`
- **Query:** How can the provided BNF grammar be written in `brag` form in Racket?
- **Summary:** The conversation revolved around converting the BNF grammar to be compatible with Racket's `brag` library.

## Tokenization with `brag`
- **Query:** Can the tokenizer be expanded to align with the custom grammar?
- **Summary:** The discussion delved into adjusting a given tokenizer to suit the custom grammar.

## Parsing Definition in Racket
- **Query:** How can the parsing definition in Racket be modified or understood better for the project?
- **Summary:** A deep dive into understanding and potentially refining a Racket-based parser definition for the custom language.

## Code Formatting
- **Query:** How can the provided Racket code be made more readable and structured?
- **Summary:** This section focused on enhancing the clarity and presentation of the given Racket code snippet.
